# Wordle
AP Computer Science Principles project (Spring 2022) 
## Gameplay
Recreation of the game Wordle from the New York Times. 
Players input their guess and the program responds with which letters are in the correct position and which letters are in the word.

## Issues
  - when a player inputs duplicate letters, the program only underlines one
  - hard to import pandas
  - adjustment required for Google Colab to PyCharm
